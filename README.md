# Slick messenger - A Slack Clone

Slick is a messaging app built with **Rails** (backend) and **React** (frontend), inspired by Slack. It allows users to create channels, send messages, and manage their accounts. This project demonstrates a full-stack approach with Rails as the backend API and React for the frontend.

## Features
- **User authentication** with email and password.
- **Create and manage channels** to organize messages.
- **Send and receive messages** within channels.
- **Responsive design** that works on both desktop and mobile.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Redux (for state management), Axios (for HTTP requests).
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.
- **Authentication**: Devise for user authentication.
- **Deployment**: Heroku for hosting.

## Live Demo
You can view the live versions of both the frontend and backend below:

- **Frontend (React)**: [Live Demo](https://frontend-link-to-your-app.herokuapp.com)
- **Backend (Rails API)**: [Live Demo](https://backend-link-to-your-api.herokuapp.com)

Feel free to try out the app by signing up and creating channels!
